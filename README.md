The changes made to the login page for the University of North Alabama's website. As a part of ongoing efforts to improve the user experience for students, it was observed that the login page was missing a crucial feature - the forgot password button.

Previously, students who forgot their password had to either email the IT department or physically visit the department in the library to reset their password. This process was time-consuming and caused inconvenience to many students who needed to access their accounts urgently. In today's fast-paced society, waiting for hours to reset a password is not an acceptable option.

To resolve this issue, I have added a "Forgot Password" button to the login page. Now, when a student forgets their password, they simply need to click on the "Forgot Password" button and follow the instructions. The student will need to enter their registered phone number to reset their password. This will save students time and effort and enable them to access their accounts quickly and easily.

I hope that this change will improve the user experience for students and help them to focus on their studies without the added stress of struggling to access their accounts.
